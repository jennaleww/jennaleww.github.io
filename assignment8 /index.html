  Essential travelers in the area will be led by convoy through the closed area, according to Caltrans District 5. The convoy will be in place for the “next several days” as crews work to fix and stabilize the roadway, according to the Monterey County Sheriffs office.

  NWS San Francisco Bay Area says the landslide on the road took place around 4 p.m. local time on Saturday.

  Park closures include Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park, Andrew Molera State Park, Limekiln State Park, Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Park and Point Sur State Historic Park, according to a release from California State Parks.
